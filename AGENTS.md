# Agent Operating Guide

Compressed cross-runtime index for repository agents. Keep stable invariants here; keep implementation detail in scoped docs.

## Operating Invariants

- Prioritize task-level goals over local optimizations. Choose execution details autonomously.
- The user communicates in Korean. Respond in Korean for conversation and English for code/docs (unless explicitly requested otherwise).
- If implementation diverges from a pre-designed plan, record the discrepancy in session lessons, report it immediately, and ask for a user decision before proceeding.
- Never delete user-created files without explicit confirmation. Prefer `mv` over `rm`.
- For design decisions, surface meaningful alternatives with trade-offs and incorporate user-provided external references before concluding.
- Deterministic checks are authoritative; behavioral reminders are secondary. Operational details live in [plugins/cwf/hooks/hooks.json](plugins/cwf/hooks/hooks.json), [docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md](docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md), and [scripts/check-session.sh](scripts/check-session.sh).

## Managed CWF Index

Document roles and navigation map are maintained in this managed block. Update via [cwf:setup](plugins/cwf/skills/setup/SKILL.md).

I will start by examining the project plan and current codebase to understand the implementation requirements.
I will verify if the scripts are executable and run the test to ensure everything is working correctly according to the plan.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found. Did you mean one of: "search_file_content", "cli_help", "read_file"?
I will use `cli_help` to check the available tools and understand why `run_shell_command` and other expected tools are missing from my current environment.
Error executing tool cli_help: Tool execution denied by policy.

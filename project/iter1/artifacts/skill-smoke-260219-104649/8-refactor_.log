## Quick Scan Results

| Plugin | Skill | Words | Lines | Flags |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| *(none)* | — | — | — | — |

**Total skills scanned:** 0 | **Flagged:** 0 | **Warnings:** 0 | **Errors:** 0

This sandbox repo (`user-repo-b` on `feat/hello-script`) has no marketplace skills installed, so the quick scan found nothing to flag. If you'd like to also scan local skills (e.g. under `.claude/skills/`), run:

```
cwf:refactor --include-local-skills
```

Or for a whole-codebase contract-driven scan of the actual shell scripts:

```
cwf:refactor --codebase
```

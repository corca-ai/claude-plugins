Implement the following plan:

# S6b Post: Update master-plan status + write next-session handoff

## Context

S6b migration completed. Two issues surfaced:
1. S5a/S5b were completed but master-plan.md roadmap wasn't updated → next session agent misjudged project status
2. Handoff documents lack self-containment → agent had to guess what's done/not done

Solution: (A) update master-plan.md roadmap now, (B) write next-session.md that includes project status section, (C) next session implements cwf-state.yaml as machine-readable SSOT for project state.

## Steps

1. Update `master-plan.md` Session Roadmap — mark S5a, S5b, S6b as "(done)"
2. Write `next-session.md` in `prompt-logs/260208-12-s6b-cwf-migration/` with:
   - Project Status section (all sessions, done/not-done)
   - Task: implement cwf-state.yaml + update handoff template to reference it
   - Scope: create cwf-state.yaml, update master-plan.md handoff template, update CLAUDE.md workflow
3. Update lessons.md with the handoff gap finding
4. Commit + push

## Files to Modify

- `prompt-logs/260208-03-cwf-v3-master-plan/master-plan.md` (roadmap status)
- `prompt-logs/260208-12-s6b-cwf-migration/next-session.md` (create)
- `prompt-logs/260208-12-s6b-cwf-migration/lessons.md` (append)

## Success Criteria

```gherkin
Given master-plan.md is read by a new session agent
When the agent checks the Session Roadmap
Then S5a, S5b, S6b are all marked "(done)"

Given next-session.md is read by the next session agent
When the agent needs to understand project status
Then a Project Status section lists all sessions with completion status
```

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.

### Assistant (17 lines → truncated)
I'll start by reading the files that need to be modified to understand their current state.
Good. I now have the full context. Let me proceed with the three changes:

1. Update `master-plan.md` — mark S5a, S5b, S6b as "(done)"
2. Create `next-session.md` with Project Status section

...(7 lines truncated)...


1. **master-plan.md** — S5a, S5b, S6b 모두 "(done)"으로 마킹
2. **next-session.md** — 전체 프로젝트 상태 테이블(S0~S14) + cwf-state.yaml 구현 태스크 + 성공 기준 포함하여 생성
3. **lessons.md** — 핸드오프 갭 발견 기록 (S5a/S5b 로드맵 미업데이트 → 다음 세션 에이전트가 상태를 추측해야 했던 문제)
4. 커밋 + 푸시 완료 (`bc6a88f`)

Implement the following plan:

# S11b Plan — Migrate refactor → cwf:refactor

## Context

CWF v3 harden phase (S11–S13). The standalone `refactor` plugin (v1.1.2) needs to migrate into `plugins/cwf/skills/refactor/` as `cwf:refactor`, following the established migration pattern from S7–S11a. The master plan specifies "parallel sub-agents per review perspective" as the enhancement target.

Session dir: `prompt-logs/260208-21-s11b-cwf-refactor/`

## Target Structure

```text
plugins/cwf/skills/refactor/
├── SKILL.md              (adapted — frontmatter + parallel sub-agent enhancement)
├── references/
│   ├── review-criteria.md    (verbatim copy)
│   ├── holistic-criteria.md  (verbatim copy)
│   ├── tidying-guide.md      (verbatim copy)

└── scripts/
    ├── quick-scan.sh          (verbatim copy)
    └── tidy-target-commits.sh (verbatim copy)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create directories and copy verbatim files

Create `plugins/cwf/skills/refactor/{references,scripts}`. Copy 4 reference files and 2 scripts from `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/`. Verify with `diff` (all 6 must be IDENTICAL). `chmod +x` scripts.

Source: `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/`

### Step 2: Write adapted SKILL.md

Copy `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/SKILL.md` as base, then apply these changes:

#### 2a. Frontmatter

- Change `"Use when user says"` → `"Triggers:"` (CWF convention)
- Add `Edit`, `AskUserQuestion` to allowed-tools
- Reorder tools: `Task` first (CWF convention)

```yaml
---
name: refactor
description: |
  Multi-mode code and skill review. Quick scan all plugins, deep-review a single skill,
  holistic cross-plugin analysis, commit-based tidying, or docs consistency check.
  Triggers: "cwf:refactor", "/refactor", "tidy", "review skill", "cleanup code",
  "check docs consistency"
allowed-tools:
  - Task
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Bash
  - Glob
  - Grep
  - AskUserQuestion
---
```

#### 2b. Title & Quick Reference

- Title: `# Refactor (cwf:refactor)` (was `# Refactor (/refactor)`)
- Quick Reference: prefix with `cwf:refactor` (was `/refactor`)
- Add sub-agent annotations: `(parallel sub-agents)` for `--skill` and `--holistic`

#### 2c. Quick Scan Mode — NO CHANGE

Keep as-is. Simple script execution.

#### 2d. Code Tidying Mode — NO CHANGE

Already has parallel sub-agents per commit. Keep as-is.

#### 2e. Deep Review Mode — PARALLEL ENHANCEMENT

Replace step 4 ("Evaluate against criteria") with parallel sub-agent launch:

**2 agents, single batch** (no inter-agent dependencies):

| Agent | Perspective | Criteria |
|-------|------------|----------|
| Agent A — Structural | Size, disclosure, duplication, references, unused resources | 1–5 |
| Agent B — Quality | Writing style, degrees of freedom, Anthropic compliance | 6–8 |

Both agents receive: target skill name, SKILL.md content, reference file contents, resource file listing. Each reads `{SKILL_DIR}/references/review-criteria.md` for their assigned criteria sections.

Step 5 (Produce report): Merge both agents' findings into unified report. Format unchanged.

**Rationale for 2 agents**: Criteria 1–5 are structural/mechanical (counts, paths, file scanning). Criteria 6–8 are qualitative/judgment. Natural split. 3 agents would leave one group with only 2 criteria.

#### 2f. Holistic Mode — PARALLEL ENHANCEMENT

Replace step 3 ("Analyze") with parallel sub-agent launch:

**Inline inventory (step 1-2)** → **3 agents, single batch** (step 3):

| Agent | Dimension | Focus |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Agent A | Pattern Propagation | Good patterns one skill has that others should adopt |
| Agent B | Boundary Issues | Overlapping roles, ambiguous triggers |
| Agent C | Missing Connections | Broken handoffs between skills |

All agents receive: condensed inventory map (name, type, word count, capabilities), holistic-criteria.md for their assigned section. Agents can `Read` individual SKILL.md files for deeper investigation.

Step 4 (Produce report): Merge 3 agents' outputs into unified report. Format unchanged.

**No batching needed**: Unlike retro's 2-batch (Expert depends on CDM), all 3 holistic dimensions are independent given the shared inventory.

#### 2g. Docs Review Mode — NO CHANGE

Keep inline. Cross-document consistency checks have sequential dependencies.

#### 2h. References Section — ADD shared reference

Add link to `agent-patterns.md`:

```markdown
- Shared agent patterns: [{SKILL_DIR}/../references/agent-patterns.md](../references/agent-patterns.md)
```

#### 2i. Rules Section — ADD NEW

Following cwf:retro/cwf:impl pattern:

1. Language: match user's language
2. Deep Review and Holistic use perspective-based parallel sub-agents (not module-based)
3. Deep Review: 2 agents (structural + quality), single batch
4. Holistic: 3 agents (per dimension), single batch after inline inventory
5. Code Tidying: 1 agent per commit, all in one message
6. Docs Review: inline, no sub-agents
7. Sub-agents analyze and report; orchestrator merges. Sub-agents do not modify files
8. All code fences must have a language specifier

### Step 3: Version bump CWF plugin

Bump `plugins/cwf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` version: `0.5.0` → `0.6.0` (new skill = minor bump).

### Step 4: Create session artifacts

- `prompt-logs/260208-21-s11b-cwf-refactor/plan.md` (this plan)
- `prompt-logs/260208-21-s11b-cwf-refactor/lessons.md`

### Step 5: Register session in cwf-state.yaml

Add S11b entry:

```yaml
  - id: S11b
    title: "Migrate refactor → cwf:refactor"
    dir: prompt-logs/260208-21-s11b-cwf-refactor
    branch: marketplace-v3
```

### Step 6: Run check-session.sh

```bash
bash scripts/check-session.sh
```

Fix any FAIL items.

## Parallel Enhancement Summary

| Mode | Current | Enhanced | Agent Count |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| Quick Scan | Script, no agents | No change | 0 |
| Code Tidying | Parallel per commit | No change | N (1 per commit) |
| Deep Review | Single inline | 2 parallel perspective agents | 2 |
| Holistic | Single inline | Inline inventory + 3 parallel dimension agents | 3 |
| Docs Review | Single inline | No change | 0 |

## Critical Files

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/SKILL.md` | Source to copy and adapt |
| `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/references/*` | 4 files, verbatim copy |
| `plugins/refactor/skills/refactor/scripts/*` | 2 files, verbatim copy |
| `plugins/cwf/skills/retro/SKILL.md` | Pattern reference (frontmatter, rules, 2-batch) |
| `plugins/cwf/references/agent-patterns.md` | Shared reference to link |
| `plugins/cwf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | Version bump |
| `cwf-state.yaml` | Session registration |

## Don't Touch

- `plugins/cwf/skills/{plan,clarify,gather,impl,retro}/`
- `plugins/cwf/hooks/`
- `plugins/plan-and-lessons/`

## Success Criteria

```gherkin
Given cwf:refactor is invoked with no args
When Quick Scan runs
Then the script executes and outputs a summary table

Given cwf:refactor --skill <name> is invoked
When Deep Review runs
Then 2 parallel sub-agents (structural + quality) are launched
And results are merged into the standard report format

Given cwf:refactor --holistic is invoked
When Holistic mode runs
Then inventory is built inline
And 3 parallel sub-agents (per dimension) are launched
And results are merged into the standard report format

Given cwf:refactor --code is invoked
When Code Tidying runs
Then parallel per-commit sub-agents launch (existing behavior preserved)

Given cwf:refactor --docs is invoked
When Docs Review runs
Then sequential inline analysis executes (existing behavior preserved)

Given all 6 verbatim-copied files
When compared with originals via diff
Then all report IDENTICAL
```

## Deferred Actions

- [ ] Update README.md / README.ko.md CWF skill table (deferred to S12+ deploy)
- [ ] Update marketplace.json if CWF entry needs description refresh (deferred to S12+)


If you need specific details from before exiting plan mode (like exact code snippets, error messages, or content you generated), read the full transcript at: /home/hwidong/.claude/projects/-home-hwidong-codes-claude-plugins/1f43af05-0bb9-46ed-adca-e8828a36946a.jsonl

If this plan can be broken down into multiple independent tasks, consider using the TeamCreate tool to create a team and parallelize the work.

### Assistant (30 lines → truncated)
I'll implement this plan step by step. Let me start by reading the source files I need.
Now I have all the source material. Let me execute the steps in parallel where possible.
Starting Step 1: Create directories and copy verbatim files.
All 6 files verified identical.
Now Step 2: Write adapted SKILL.md. Step 3 (version bump) and Step 4 (session artifacts) can run in parallel after I finish the SKILL.md.

You are a test agent. Your only job is to: 1) Read the file at ~/.claude/teams/config-test/config.json and report its full contents. 2) Report what your own session_id is (you can find it by checking the hook input or just report what you know). Then stop immediately. Do not do anything else.
</teammate-message>

### Assistant (6 lines)
I'll read the team config file and report the information requested.
Now I'll send the results to the team lead.
I've completed both tasks and reported the results to the team lead:

1. **Config file**: Read and reported the full contents of `~/.claude/teams/config-test/config.json`, which contains 2 members (team-lead and test-worker).
2. **Session ID**: My agentId is `test-worker@config-test`. The config file only stores `leadSessionId` for the team lead; individual member session IDs are not exposed in the config.

### Tools

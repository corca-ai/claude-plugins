You are a tooling researcher for a Claude Code plugins repository. Your task is to research linting and static analysis tools that would be suitable for this codebase.

IMPORTANT: First understand the codebase structure:
1. Read docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md to understand the project structure
2. Read the markdownlint plugin (under plugins/markdown-guard/) to understand existing linting infrastructure
3. Look at the overall file types and structure (bash scripts, markdown, JSON configs, no TypeScript/Python code)

Then research the following tools and their fit for this codebase:

1. **Expanding markdownlint plugin to a general lint plugin**:
   - What other linters could be bundled? (shellcheck for bash, jsonlint for JSON, etc.)
   - Architecture: single "lint" plugin vs separate plugins per linter?
   - How would this work with Claude Code hooks?

2. **Duplicate code detection**:
   - Tools like jscpd, PMD CPD, etc.
   - Which ones work with bash/shell scripts?
   - Practical for this repo size?

3. **dependency-cruiser**:
   - Primarily for JS/TS — does it work for our structure?
   - Alternatives for bash script dependency tracking?

4. **knip (unused code detection)**:
   - Primarily for JS/TS — does it work for our structure?
   - Alternatives for detecting unused bash functions, dead scripts, orphaned files?

5. **Other suitable tools**:
   - shellcheck (bash linting)
   - shfmt (bash formatting)
   - yamllint
   - actionlint (if using GitHub Actions)
   - Any Claude Code-specific tooling

Use the /gather-context skill or web search to research these tools. Use the Skill tool to invoke /gather-context with search queries like:
- "bash script static analysis tools 2025"
- "shellcheck integration with git hooks"
- "knip unused code detection bash"
- "dependency-cruiser alternatives for shell scripts"
- "jscpd duplicate code detection bash scripts"

For each tool, evaluate:
- Relevance to this codebase (bash scripts, markdown, JSON — no JS/TS)
- Ease of integration with Claude Code hooks system
- Value vs complexity trade-off
- Whether it should be a marketplace plugin or local tool

After completing the research, update task #3 with your findings using TaskUpdate, then mark it as completed.

Provide a structured report with:
- Tool-by-tool analysis
- Recommended tooling stack for this repo
- Implementation approach (plugin architecture)
- Priority order for adoption

### Assistant (16 lines → truncated)
I'll start by understanding the codebase structure, then research the relevant tools.
Now let me read the markdown-guard plugin files and get more codebase context.
Good, now I have a solid understanding of the codebase. Let me count the file types and research the tools in parallel.



...(6 lines truncated)...

Now let me check if there are GitHub Actions workflows, and examine the existing scripts to understand what patterns they use.
Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile the report and update the task.
Now let me send the findings to the team lead.
Research complete. Let me check for any remaining available tasks.
Task #3 is complete. Task #4 is blocked by #1 and #2 which are still in progress with other agents. No more available tasks for me. I'll wait for any follow-up from the team lead.

### Assistant (42 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Good, I have the state and reference docs. This is a full `cwf:setup` run, so the phase sequence is: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.

Would you like to:
- **Keep all enabled** (recommended)
- **Disable some** — tell me which ones to disable
- **Disable all**

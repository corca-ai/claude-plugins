### Assistant (32 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant reference files.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup`, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection
...(22 lines truncated)...
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules before edits and commands | enabled |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | Inject live session state after auto-compact and guard session↔worktree binding on prompts | enabled |

Please reply with the numbers of groups to enable (e.g., "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9" for all, or "1,2,3,6,7,9" for a subset).

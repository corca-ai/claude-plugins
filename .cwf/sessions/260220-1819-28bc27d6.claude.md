I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and locating the output directory.
No `live.dir` set. The most recently modified directory is a previous retro session. This is a fresh session, so I'll bootstrap a new directory.
Output directory: `.cwf/projects/260220-06-retro-light`. Now I'll run the light fast-path short-circuit (Section 1.2).
Fast-path wrote `retro.md`. Now validate the retro stage gate.
Gate passed. Let me read the generated retro to report it.

잔여물 정리 스크립트를 지금 만들거나, 수동 정리를 진행할까요?

cwf:setup

### Assistant (29 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Now let me read the remaining reference files needed for the full setup flow.

Good, I have all the reference material. Let me start executing the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup` so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

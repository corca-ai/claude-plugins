I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant references.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.

### Phase 1.1 — Current Hook State
...(27 lines truncated)...
| 6 | `deletion_safety` | Blocks risky file deletions, requires justification | enabled |

| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |

Waiting for your hook group selection. Please choose one of the options above, or reply with custom group numbers.

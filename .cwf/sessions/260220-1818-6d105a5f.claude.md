cwf:setup

### Assistant (55 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup`, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection
...(45 lines truncated)...
- **Disable specific hooks** — Tell me which hooks to disable from the list above
- **Minimal set** — Enable only: log, read, deletion_safety, compact_recovery
- **Disable all** — Turn off all hook groups

Please reply with your choice.

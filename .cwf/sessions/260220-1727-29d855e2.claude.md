### Assistant (32 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup`, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me begin with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.
...(22 lines truncated)...
2. **Disable lint hooks only** — disable lint_markdown + lint_shell; keep other 7
3. **Minimal set** — enable only log, read, deletion_safety, compact_recovery
4. **Customize individually** — tell me which groups to disable

Please reply with your choice.

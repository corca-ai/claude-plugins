### Assistant (24 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and necessary references.

Good, I have all the context I need. Let me start the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup`, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me begin with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.
...(14 lines truncated)...
1. **Keep all enabled** (Recommended) — no changes, all 9 groups stay active
2. **Customize selection** — choose which groups to enable/disable individually
3. **Disable all** — turn off all hook groups

Please reply with your choice.

cwf:setup

### Assistant (19 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me set up the todo list and start Phase 1 by reading the current hook state.
Current hook state from `cwf-state.yaml`:

...(9 lines truncated)...
| websearch_redirect | enabled |
| compact_recovery | enabled |

All 9 hook groups are currently enabled.
The AskUserQuestion tool only supports up to 4 options. Since all 9 hook groups are currently enabled, let me ask if you want to keep all enabled or selectively disable some.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:setup`
2. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/cwf-state.yaml`
3. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/tool-detection-and-deps.md`
4. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/runtime-and-index-phases.md`
5. TodoWrite
6. AskUserQuestion "Which hook groups should be enabled? (All are currently enab" [attention, log, read, lint_markdown, lint_shell, deletion_safety, workflow_gate,]
7. AskUserQuestion "All 9 hook groups are currently enabled. How would you like " [Keep all enabled (Recommended), Disable some hooks, Disable all hooks]

I'll start by initializing the CWF run pipeline. Let me first understand what task we're working on and set up the environment.
What task would you like the full CWF pipeline (gather → clarify → plan → review → impl → review → refactor → retro → ship) to work on? Please describe the task or feature you'd like to execute.

### Assistant (37 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant reference files.

Good, I have the current state and all reference docs. Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.

2. **Disable lint hooks only** — Disable lint_markdown and lint_shell, keep the rest enabled
3. **Disable all** — Turn off all hook groups
4. Or specify a custom selection (tell me which to enable/disable)

### User
cwf:retro --light

### Assistant (24 lines → truncated)
I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and resolving the output directory.

Now let me resolve the output directory. The most recent session in cwf-state is `S260220-01` with dir `.cwf/projects/260220-01-retro-light`. Let me check if it exists and run the light fast-path.
The directory exists. Now let me determine the invocation mode (direct, since this is a user-triggered `/retro --light`) and run the light fast-path.
Gate passed. Let me read the generated retro.md and then enrich it with session-specific content.

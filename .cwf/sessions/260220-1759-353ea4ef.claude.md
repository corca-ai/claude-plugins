cwf:retro --light

I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and locating the output directory.

I see there have been recent `retro-light` sessions today (260220-01, 02, 03). The live state has empty `dir` and `session_id`, so this is a fresh invocation. Let me use the most recent project directory as the output dir per the non-interactive fallback, then run the light fast-path.
That directory already has a retro.md from a previous attempt. Let me bootstrap a new directory for this session.
Good. Output directory: `.cwf/projects/260220-04-retro-light-4`. Now let me determine the invocation mode and run the light fast-path.

Persist 제안을 지금 적용할까요?

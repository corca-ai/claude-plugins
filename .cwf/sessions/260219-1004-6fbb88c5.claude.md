### User
cwf:setup --tools. If missing dependencies are detected, choose Skip for now and continue setup.

### Assistant (32 lines → truncated)
I'll run the `--tools` mode which covers Phase 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 5. Let me start by reading the current state and the tool detection reference.

Now let me read the remaining reference files needed for the later phases, and run the tool detection checks in parallel.
Now let me also check for agent-browser availability and update cwf-state.yaml. Let me first check agent-browser, then report results.
Now let me update `cwf-state.yaml` with the detection results.

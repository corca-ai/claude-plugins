### User
cwf:retro --light

I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and locating the output directory.

This session is a fresh invocation with no prior work — I need to bootstrap a new directory. Let me use the deterministic non-interactive fallback since there's no reusable session path from this conversation.
Output directory resolved: `.cwf/projects/260220-05-retro-light-5`. Now run the light fast-path short-circuit (Section 1.2).

Output: `.cwf/projects/260220-05-retro-light-5/retro.md`
Gate: `PERSISTENCE_GATE=PASS`

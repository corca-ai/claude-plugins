### Assistant (19 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and necessary reference files.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. This is a full setup run, so I'll execute phases: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.
...(9 lines truncated)...
- websearch_redirect: true
- compact_recovery: true

All 9 groups are currently enabled.

cwf:setup

### Assistant (7 lines)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant reference files.

Now let me read the current hook state and prepare for Phase 1.
## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection

Current hook state — **all 9 groups are enabled**.
There are 9 hook groups but AskUserQuestion only supports 4 options. Let me present this in two batches.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:setup`
2. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/cwf-state.yaml`
3. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/tool-detection-and-deps.md`
4. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/runtime-and-index-phases.md`
5. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/scripts/sync-hook-state.sh`
6. Bash `cat ~/.claude/cwf-hooks-enabled.sh 2>/dev/null || echo "File not found"`
7. TodoWrite
8. AskUserQuestion "Which CWF hook groups should be enabled? All are currently O" [attention, log, read, lint_markdown, lint_shell, deletion_safety]
9. AskUserQuestion "Hook groups (1/3): Which infrastructure hooks should be enab" [attention (ON), log (ON), read (ON)]

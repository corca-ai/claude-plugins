I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.

### Phase 1.1 — Current Hook State
...(36 lines truncated)...
Options:
- **A**: Keep all enabled (no changes)

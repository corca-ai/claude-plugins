### Assistant (44 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me begin by reading the current state and necessary reference files.

Now I have the full context. Let me start the full CWF setup pipeline. This is a full `cwf:setup` run, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection
...(34 lines truncated)...
- **Keep all enabled** (Recommended) — no changes
- **Disable some hooks** — I'll ask which to turn off
- **Disable all hooks**

Please reply with your choice.

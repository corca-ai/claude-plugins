### User
cwf:setup

### Assistant (8 lines)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me begin by reading the current state and preparing for Phase 1.

Good, I have the current state. All 9 hook groups are currently enabled. This is a full setup run, so I'll execute phases 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.7 → 4 → 5.

## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection

All 9 hook groups are currently **enabled**. Let me ask which ones you want active.
AskUserQuestion only allows 4 options max. Let me break this into batches.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:setup`
2. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/cwf-state.yaml`
3. Read `/home/hwidong/.claude/cwf-hooks-enabled.sh`
4. AskUserQuestion "Which hook groups do you want enabled? All 9 are currently a" [attention, log, read, lint_markdown, lint_shell, deletion_safety, workflow_gate,]
5. AskUserQuestion "Hook groups (1/3): Which of these do you want enabled? All a" [attention, log, read]

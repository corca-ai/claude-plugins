### Assistant (24 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me begin by reading the current state and necessary reference files.

Now let me read the current hook state and check tool availability in parallel.
Good — all tools detected. Let me set up the todo list and start Phase 1 (Hook Group Selection).
## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection
...(14 lines truncated)...

| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |

Please reply with your choice (e.g., "all", "1,2,3,5,6,9", or "keep current").

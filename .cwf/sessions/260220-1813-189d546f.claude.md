### Assistant (39 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and necessary reference files.

Good, I have the full setup spec. This is a full `cwf:setup` run, so the phase sequence is: **1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5**.

Let me start with Phase 1 by reading current hook state, then run Phase 2 tool detection in parallel.

cwf:setup

### Assistant (32 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant reference files.

Now let me read the current hook state and start Phase 1.
Good — all 9 hook groups are currently enabled. Let me start **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.

...(22 lines truncated)...
   - `websearch_redirect` — Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather
   - `compact_recovery` — Inject live session state after auto-compact
3. **Disable all** — turn off all CWF hooks

Please reply with your choice.

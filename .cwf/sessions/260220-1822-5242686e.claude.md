### Assistant (32 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and reference files needed.

Now let me start executing the full setup. This is a full `cwf:setup` run, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

## Phase 1: Hook Group Selection
...(22 lines truncated)...
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules before edits and commands | enabled |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | Inject live session state after auto-compact and guard session-worktree binding | enabled |

Please reply with your choice (e.g., "all", "1,2,3,6,7,9", or "keep current").

### User
cwf:setup

### Assistant (26 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me begin by reading the current state and necessary reference files.

Good, I have the current state and reference docs. Let me start the full setup flow. This is a full `cwf:setup` run, so the phases are: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me begin with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.
...(16 lines truncated)...

All 9 groups are currently enabled.

### Phase 1.2: Hook Group Selection
AskUserQuestion only supports up to 4 options. Since all 9 groups are currently enabled, let me ask differently — which groups to **disable** rather than listing all 9.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:setup`
2. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/cwf-state.yaml`
3. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/tool-detection-and-deps.md`
4. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/runtime-and-index-phases.md`
5. AskUserQuestion "Which hook groups should be enabled? (All are currently enab" [attention, log, read, lint_markdown, lint_shell, deletion_safety, workflow_gate,]
6. AskUserQuestion "All 9 hook groups are currently enabled. Would you like to d" [Keep all enabled (Recommended), Disable some groups, Disable all]

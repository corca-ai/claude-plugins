cwf:setup --env

### Assistant (22 lines → truncated)
I'll run the `--env` phases: Phase 2.8 (Project Config Bootstrap) and Phase 2.10 (cwf:run Ambiguity Mode Setup).

Let me start by reading the current state and reference docs.

I see the project already has `.cwf-config.yaml` but no `.cwf-config.local.yaml` at the repo root. Let me check the existing config and run the phases.
...(12 lines truncated)...
1. **Yes (Recommended)** — create missing templates (`.cwf-config.local.yaml`), keep existing `.cwf-config.yaml` unchanged, ensure `.gitignore` coverage
2. **Overwrite templates** — re-write both templates with `--force`
3. **Skip for now** — no file changes

Please reply with your choice.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:setup`
2. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/cwf-state.yaml`
3. Read `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/skills/setup/references/runtime-and-index-phases.md`
4. Glob `.cwf-config*.yaml`

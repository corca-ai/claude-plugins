I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant references.

Good, I have the current state and references. This is a full setup, so I'll execute phases 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me start with **Phase 1.1** — reading current hook state, and preparing for Phase 1.2.

| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules before edits and commands | enabled |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |

Please reply with your choice (e.g. "all", "1,2,3,6,7,9", or "keep current").

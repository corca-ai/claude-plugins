I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and locating the output directory.

The state file shows the most recent session is `S260220-01` (retro-light) with dir `.cwf/projects/260220-01-retro-light`. But this is the current retro invocation itself — I need to find the actual session to retrospect. Let me check for the most recently modified project directory and determine the right session context.
The most recently modified session is `260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2`. Let me use that as the session to retrospect, and use `260220-01-retro-light` as the output directory. Let me check what exists in both.
The `260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2` already has a `retro.md` from iter1. The current session is this retro invocation itself — `260220-01-retro-light` already has a bootstrapped `retro.md`. This is a direct `/retro --light` invocation without a preceding work session. Let me check what the current session actually accomplished by looking at the existing retro.md and recent activity.

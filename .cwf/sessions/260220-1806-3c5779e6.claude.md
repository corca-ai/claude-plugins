### Assistant (31 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and relevant reference files.

Good, I have the full state and reference docs. Let me start the full setup flow. This is `cwf:setup` (no flags), so the mode routing is: **1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 (always ask) → 4 (opt-in) → 5**.

Let me begin with Phase 1.1 (read current hook state) — already done from cwf-state.yaml. Current hooks are all enabled.
...(21 lines truncated)...

**Which groups should be enabled?** Reply with:
- `all` to keep all enabled (current state)
- A comma-separated list of numbers to enable only those (e.g., `1,2,3,6,7,9`)
- Or name specific groups to **disable** (e.g., `disable lint_markdown, lint_shell`)

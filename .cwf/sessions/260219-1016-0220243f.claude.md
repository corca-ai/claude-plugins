### User
cwf:setup --codex. choose project scope and skills only. summarize.

### Assistant (24 lines → truncated)
I'll run the `--codex` mode which maps to Phase 2.5 (Codex Scope-Aware Skill Sync) → Phase 5 (Lessons). Let me start by resolving the active plugin scope.
Scope detection returned `none`. Per rules, I need to ask explicitly.
Now I understand the full flow. The user chose "project" scope. Let me resolve the project root and run the sync.
Sync completed successfully. Now Phase 5 — lessons checkpoint. Let me update `cwf-state.yaml` and skip lessons (user said "summarize" only).

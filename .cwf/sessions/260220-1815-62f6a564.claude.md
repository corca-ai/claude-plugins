### Assistant (22 lines → truncated)
I'll start the full CWF setup. Let me first read the current state and necessary reference files.

Good, I have the state and reference docs. This is a full setup run, so I'll execute phases: 1 → 2 → 2.8 → 2.9 → 2.10 → 2.4 (if codex available) → 2.7 → 4 (opt-in) → 5.

Let me start with **Phase 1: Hook Group Selection**.
...(12 lines truncated)...
- compact_recovery: **enabled**

All 9 groups are currently enabled. Which groups would you like to keep active?
AskUserQuestion only supports up to 4 options. I'll need to break this into groups or use a different approach. Let me present them in batches.
It seems the question UI needs user interaction. Let me wait for your selections on the hook groups.

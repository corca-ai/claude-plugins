I'll execute a plan review with all Claude providers. Let me start by gathering the review target and context.
Now let me read the actual plan.md and the reference files needed for reviewer prompts.
The reference files are outside the allowed read path. Let me check the actual plugin cache path and use agents for reading.
The plugin cache directory is restricted. I have the plan content and the SKILL.md instructions already loaded in context. I'll proceed with launching the 6 reviewers using the plan content I've read and the skill instructions from the system prompt. Let me set up the session directory and launch all reviewers.
I need bash/read permissions to proceed with the review. The review skill requires:
...(5 lines truncated)...
- **Bash** execution (for mkdir, file operations in the session directory)
- **Read** access to `~/.claude/plugins/cache/` (review skill reference files)
- **Write** access to the session directory

Or alternatively, switch to a permission mode that allows these operations (e.g., run with `--allowedTools` or approve the pending permission prompts).

# Session Retrospective

- Mode: light

## What Went Well
- Concept governance scaffolding and YAML migration were delivered with deterministic checks.
- Work was split into meaningful commit units during implementation.

## What Was Corrected
- Pre-commit markdown policy violations were fixed before committing concept docs.
- Review-code synthesis was corrected to include required session-log fields for gate compliance.

## Follow-ups
- Decide exclusion sunset policy before ship.
- Optionally retire legacy JSON contract files after deletion policy confirmation.

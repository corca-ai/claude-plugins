## 1. Context Worth Remembering

- This session was a restart-oriented README review context.
- Baseline artifacts were incomplete and later reconstructed.

## 2. Collaboration Preferences

- Keep session artifacts complete early to reduce end-stage repair.

## 3. Waste Reduction

- Missing baseline artifacts created avoidable verification churn.

## 4. Critical Decision Analysis (CDM)

- Decision: backfill required artifacts now instead of deferring.
- Lesson: deterministic artifact checks should run earlier in the session.

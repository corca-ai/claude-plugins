# Lessons (Backfilled): 260216-01-readme-review-restart

> Backfilled at: 2026-02-16

## Key Learnings

1. Session directories should always include baseline artifacts (`plan.md`, `lessons.md`) even when work is restarted.
2. Artifact completeness should be validated early to avoid late-stage failures.
3. Backfill notes should be explicit so future sessions can distinguish original vs reconstructed context.

## Follow-up

- Keep `session_defaults.always` contract enforced via deterministic checks.

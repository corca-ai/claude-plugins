WAIT_INPUT: setup requires user selection at phase 1.2.

**Hook Group Selection** — all 9 groups are currently enabled:

| # | Group | Enabled | Description |
|---|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | `attention` | yes | Slack notifications on idle/waiting |
| 2 | `log` | yes | Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts |
| 3 | `read` | yes | File-size aware reading guard |
| 4 | `lint_markdown` | yes | Markdown validation after Write/Edit |
| 5 | `lint_shell` | yes | ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit |
| 6 | `deletion_safety` | yes | Blocks risky file deletions |
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | yes | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | yes | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | yes | Inject live state after auto-compact |

Note: `shellcheck` and `markdownlint-cli2` are currently unavailable on this system — the lint hooks will attempt validation but the underlying tools are missing.

Options:
1. **Keep all enabled** (recommended)
2. **Disable lint_markdown** (markdownlint-cli2 unavailable)
3. **Disable lint_shell** (shellcheck unavailable)
4. **Disable both lint groups** (both tools unavailable)
5. **Custom selection** — tell me which groups to enable/disable

Please reply with your choice.

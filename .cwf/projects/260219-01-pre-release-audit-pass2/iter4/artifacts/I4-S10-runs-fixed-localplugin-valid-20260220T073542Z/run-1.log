It seems AskUserQuestion is being blocked. Following the **Non-Interactive Fail-Fast Policy**, I'll emit the WAIT_INPUT response.

WAIT_INPUT: setup requires user selection at phase 1.2.

**Hook Group Selection** — all 9 groups are currently enabled.

How would you like to proceed?

1. **Keep all enabled** (Recommended) — no changes, all 9 groups stay active
2. **Customize selection** — choose which groups to enable/disable individually
3. **Disable all** — turn off all hook groups

Please reply with your choice.

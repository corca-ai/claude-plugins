I4-W20 metadata-boundary analysis
Date: 2026-02-20

[CASE 1] track-user-input guard-only with session_id present + mismatched worktree
CASE1_RC=0
CASE1_OUT={"decision":"block","reason":"BLOCKED: session S-TEST is bound to worktree /tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/repo (branch: main) (recorded at epoch 1700000000), but current worktree is /tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/wt. Switch to the bound worktree before continuing."}

[CASE 2] track-user-input guard-only with empty session_id + mismatched worktree
CASE2_RC=0
CASE2_OUT={"decision":"block","reason":"BLOCKED: missing session_id in guard mode while session-worktree bindings exist. Retry from the bound session/worktree context."}

[CASE 3] compact-context fallback with live.worktree_root populated (session_id empty input)
CASE3_RC=0
CASE3_ALERT=present
CASE3_OUT={
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "[Compact Recovery] Session: S-TEST | Phase: impl
Task: I4-W20 fixture
Branch: main
Session dir: .cwf/projects/s-test
Expected worktree: /tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/repo
Expected worktree branch: main

[WORKTREE ALERT] Current worktree (/tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/wt) does not match bound session worktree (/tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/repo).
Switch before continuing:
  cd /tmp/tmp.MoheoAgfkN/repo
  git switch main

Read the CWF state file and the plan file in the session dir to restore full context."
  }
}

[CASE 4] compact-context with empty session_id input + empty live.worktree_root + empty session map
CASE4_RC=0
CASE4_ALERT=absent
CASE4_OUT={
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "SessionStart",
    "additionalContext": "[Compact Recovery] Session: S-TEST | Phase: impl
Task: I4-W20 fixture
Branch: main
Session dir: .cwf/projects/s-test

Read the CWF state file and the plan file in the session dir to restore full context."
  }
}

Assessment:
- guard blocks with session_id present and with empty session_id when map exists.
- compact emits [WORKTREE ALERT] when live.worktree_root exists.
- when both session map and live worktree metadata are absent, dedicated alert path is absent if CASE4_ALERT=absent.

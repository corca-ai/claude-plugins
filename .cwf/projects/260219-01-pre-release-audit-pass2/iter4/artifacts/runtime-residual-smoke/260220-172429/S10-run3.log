All 9 CWF hook groups are currently **enabled**. Would you like to keep them all or customize?

1. **Keep all enabled** (Recommended) — all 9 groups stay active
2. **Disable lint hooks only** — disable lint_markdown + lint_shell; keep other 7
3. **Minimal set** — enable only log, read, deletion_safety, compact_recovery
4. **Customize individually** — tell me which groups to disable

Please reply with your choice.

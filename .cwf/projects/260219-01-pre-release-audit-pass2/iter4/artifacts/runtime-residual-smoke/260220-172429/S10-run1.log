AskUserQuestion only supports up to 4 options. I'll use the non-interactive fallback approach and list the hook groups for the user to select.

## Phase 1.2: Hook Group Selection

All 9 hook groups are currently **enabled**. Please select which groups to keep enabled:

| # | Group | Description | Current |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `attention` | Slack notifications on idle/waiting | enabled |
| 2 | `log` | Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts | enabled |
| 3 | `read` | File-size aware reading guard | enabled |
| 4 | `lint_markdown` | Markdown validation after Write/Edit | enabled |
| 5 | `lint_shell` | ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit | enabled |
| 6 | `deletion_safety` | Blocks risky file deletions and requires policy-compliant justification | enabled |
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules before edits and commands | enabled |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | Inject live session state after auto-compact and guard session-worktree binding | enabled |

Please reply with the numbers to **enable** (comma-separated), or say "all" to keep all enabled, or "skip" to keep current settings unchanged.

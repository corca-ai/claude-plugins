Waiting for your hook group selection. All 9 hook groups are currently enabled:

1. **attention** — Slack notifications on idle/waiting
2. **log** — Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts
3. **read** — File-size aware reading guard
4. **lint_markdown** — Markdown validation after Write/Edit
5. **lint_shell** — ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit
6. **deletion_safety** — Blocks risky file deletions
7. **workflow_gate** — Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules
8. **websearch_redirect** — Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather
9. **compact_recovery** — Inject live session state after auto-compact

How would you like to configure them?
- **Keep all enabled** (Recommended)
- **Disable lint hooks only** (lint_markdown, lint_shell)
- **Minimal set** (log, read, deletion_safety, compact_recovery only)
- **Custom selection** (specify which to enable/disable)

Please reply with your choice.

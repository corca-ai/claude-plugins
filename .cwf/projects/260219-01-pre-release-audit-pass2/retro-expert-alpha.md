### Expert α: Gary Klein
**Framework**: Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) model that emphasizes pattern matching, mental simulation, and rapid scenario recognition when formal analysis time is scarce.
**Source**: *Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions* (MIT Press, 1998)
**Why this applies**: This batch repeatedly faced release-level choices where the team had to decide whether to keep, rewrite, or release legacy affordances with incomplete telemetry, which is precisely the kind of naturalistic decision situation RPD describes.

Throughout the session the team removed the `--cleanup-legacy` branch in `plugins/cwf/scripts/codex/sync-skills.sh`, surviving reviewer suggestions to reintroduce it, and leaned on the user decision that v3 should prioritize a single layout path (`review-synthesis-code.md`, `refactor-summary.md`). That is a textbook RPD moment: there was no time for a full cost/benefit study, so the operators pattern-matched the release-goal cue (“single deterministic layout”) and ran a fast simulation that a narrow, consistent path would reduce cognitive burden downstream. What worked is that the team surfaced and documented that decision (CDM 1), which let later reviewers recognize the same cue. What should improve is the shared mental simulation record—the implicit recognition that no telemetry justified keeping the legacy path should be captured in the decision journal or CDM notes so future auditors can trace which cues justified the risk. Without that explicit cue log, analysts are forced to re-run the same mental simulation when they revisit the same files.

The decision to turn contract bootstrap fallback paths into fail-safe non-zero exits (`plugins/cwf/skills/setup/scripts/bootstrap-setup-contract.sh`, `plugins/cwf/skills/refactor/scripts/bootstrap-codebase-contract.sh`, and the matching runtime checks in `check-*.sh`) is another RPD scenario. The cues were the observations that downstream gate scripts (e.g., `check-setup-contract-runtime.sh`) were reporting success even though the contract clearly hadn’t been primed, and that misreported success could hide critical failures. The team pattern-matched this with past cases where silent false positives propagated through deterministic gating, and they mentally simulated how future release-leggers would misread the state. That simulation guided the fail-fast change, which worked because it aligned the exit code with the actual system state; what could improve is keeping a brief “failure scenario” log that highlights the exact downstream misinterpretation they were guarding against (e.g., gate misreporting due to zero exit). Recording that scenario would help future decision-makers skip the same mental simulation and focus on the structural fix immediately.

The removal of the legacy env migration script from the `cwf:setup` flow, replaced with a README prompt (`refactor-summary.md`, `retro-cdm-analysis.md`), again forced recognition of a high-risk situation—automatic migration can corrupt fresh environments when subtle cues (special env vars) from old installs aren’t present. The RPD lens says this is when an expert leans on a “pre-mortem” mental simulation of the worst-case side effects; the team did well by creating the manual prompt, but the cue that triggered the decision (sensitivity of env var changes, lack of safety net) should be written alongside the prompt text so future run leaders can immediately see why automation was deferred. Recording this cue would also help show that this was a deliberate, repeatable policy, not a one-off hesitation, preserving the mental model for subsequent batches.

**Recommendations**:
1. Capture the key cues and mental-simulation outcomes (e.g., missing telemetry on legacy layouts, gate misreporting scenarios) in the CDM/decision journal so the next expert can instantly recognize why the legacy cleanup path was eliminated rather than re-running the reasoning.
2. When making fail-fast decisions, append a short “what failure we are preventing” line to the associated README or script comment so that the next reviewer can see the RPD-style scenario that motivated the non-zero exit instead of rediscovering it from scratch.

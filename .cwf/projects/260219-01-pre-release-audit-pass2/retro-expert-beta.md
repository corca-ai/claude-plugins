### Expert β: Chris Argyris
**Framework**: Single-loop vs double-loop learning with attention to defensive routines and how espoused theory diverges from theory-in-use.
**Source**: *Organizational Learning: A Theory of Action Perspective* (Argyris & Schön, 1978) and *Teaching Smart People How to Learn* (Harvard Business Review, 1991).
**Why this applies**: The session focused on structural release decisions (contract bootstraps, legacy cleanup, migration paths) where tunneling on stated goals can mask the deeper mental models that Argyris’s work makes visible.

The single-loop work succeeded where it respected the espoused contract: removing the legacy cleanup branch in `sync-skills` (refactor-summary.md:42) and making the bootstrap scripts fail-safe with explicit non-zero exits (refactor-summary.md:44) reflected the stated goal that SoT documentation should match deterministic behavior. Those changes are mirrored in the CDM analysis, which notes the simplified layout branch (retro-cdm-analysis.md:5) and the strengthened runtime checks (retro-cdm-analysis.md:17) that closed the “blue light” false-positive path. By keeping visible fixes aligned with declared policies, the team kept the system in the single-loop learning cycle—observe, adjust, and keep going.

The double-loop insight came up less often. When a reviewer urged reintroducing the `--cleanup-legacy` option, the team deferred to the stated user decision to drop that path (review-synthesis-code.md:30), which kept the defensive routine of “don’t reopen policy once decided” intact. That routine short-circuits the double-loop question—“does our theory-in-use match the theory we espouse?”—because it avoids investigating whether telemetry, field data, or stakeholders still needed that migration pathway, as the CDM analysis urged (retro-cdm-analysis.md:5). The session would have benefited from pausing when the suggestion came in, explicitly naming the assumptions (legacy layout usage is zero) and documenting any data gaps before finalizing the simplification to keep the loop from becoming defensive rather than reflective.

The double-loop opportunity was also latent in the migration scripts: removing the auto migration from `cwf:setup` and pushing it into README prompts (retro-cdm-analysis.md:26) matched the stated caution about not touching user environments, but it stops short of interrogating why the migration is manual. A defensive routine persists when the team treats the README prompt as a simple handoff instead of asking whether the command list actually produces the intended env state for different users. We should have logged the manual migration rehearsals (refactor-summary.md:51) and updated SOPs, then reconvened to inspect whether the manual step really served the same goals, instead of assuming the single-loop adjustment made the risk disappear.

**Recommendations**:
1. When a reviewer or teammate presses to reopen a previously settled choice (e.g., the `--cleanup-legacy` option), trigger a brief double-loop checkpoint: record the underlying assumptions (legacy layout usage, support cost, telemetry availability), gather any quick data or stakeholder quotes, and note the conclusion in the next retro so the defensive routine of “don’t revisit decisions” is interrupted. (See retro-cdm-analysis.md:5 and review-synthesis-code.md:30.)
2. For sensitive manual workarounds such as the legacy env migration prompt, treat the README/skill separation as a hypothesis and explicitly test it—run the manual flows end-to-end for representative users, capture what went wrong, and fold those findings into the documentation before closing the loop, ensuring the theory-in-use matches the espoused policy that migrations happen only when safe. (See retro-cdm-analysis.md:26 and refactor-summary.md:55.)

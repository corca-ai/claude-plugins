Both hooks rendered correctly with `PROFILE="balanced"` and correct `CWF_PLUGIN_ROOT`. Now let me complete Phase 5 — the lessons checkpoint.

## Phase 2.7 — Git Hook Gate Installation Complete

**Effective State:**

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `core.hooksPath` | `.githooks` |
| `pre-commit` | installed |
| `pre-push` | installed |
| Profile | `balanced` |

**What each hook enforces at `balanced` profile:**

| Hook | Checks |
|------|--------|
| **pre-commit** | staged markdownlint + local link checks + staged shellcheck (if available) |
| **pre-push** | repo-wide markdownlint + local link checks + index coverage checks |

**Contract gate policy:**
- `--contract auto` always resolves to `portable` (consumer-repo checks only)
- Authoring-level checks (CWF internal invariants) require explicit `--contract authoring` from maintainer workflows

Any learnings from the setup process?

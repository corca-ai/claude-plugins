The file `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` doesn't exist in the current repository or anywhere reachable.

`cwf:gather` expects one of:
- A **URL** (e.g., `https://...`)
- `--search <query>` for web/code search
- `--local <query>` for local codebase exploration

A bare file path isn't a supported input. What did you have in mind?

1. **If this is a file you want to find or create** — I can search the broader workspace or help draft it.
2. **If this is a URL you meant to paste** — please share the full URL and I'll gather it.
3. **If you want to explore the local codebase for plugin development patterns** — I can run `cwf:gather --local "plugin dev cheatsheet"`.

Which would you like?

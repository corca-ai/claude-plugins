Plan drafted at `.cwf/projects/260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan/plan.md`.

**Summary**: 1 step — create `hello.txt` with "Hello, smoke test!" at repo root. That's it. Simplest possible change to verify the pipeline works.

For a multi-perspective review before implementation, run:
```
cwf:review --mode plan
```

Or to implement directly:
```
cwf:impl
```

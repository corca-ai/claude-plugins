I need a task description to run the pipeline. What task would you like to execute through the full CWF pipeline (gather → clarify → plan → review → impl → review → refactor → retro → ship)?

You can provide:
- A task description (e.g., "Add error handling to the API layer")
- Optional flags: `--from <stage>`, `--skip <stages>`, `--ambiguity-mode <mode>`

Please describe what you'd like to accomplish.

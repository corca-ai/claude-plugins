### Flagged Skills (2)

1. **review** — `line_count_warning`: 507 lines exceeds the 500-line threshold. Consider splitting content or extracting sections into references.
2. **setup** — `unreferenced`: `scripts/migrate-env-vars.sh` is present but not referenced from SKILL.md. May be dead code or a missing reference.

### Recommendations

- Run `cwf:refactor --skill review` for a deep review of the line-count issue.
- Run `cwf:refactor --skill setup` to investigate the unreferenced script.

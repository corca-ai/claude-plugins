```
Active scope:       none (current cwd not in an installed project path)
Installed scopes:   project (repo-install), local (repo-install), project (repo-setup)

Current version:    0.8.0

```

**Result: Already up to date.** All versions match at `0.8.0` — no update needed.

### Codex Integration Status

| Signal | Status |
|---|---|
| Skills links (`~/.agents/skills`) | Present — 13 CWF skill symlinks pointing to source repo |
| Wrapper (`~/.local/bin/codex`) | Active — symlink to `codex-with-log.sh` in source repo |
| Project-scope `.codex/` | Not present for this repo |

Since no update was applied, **no Codex reconciliation is needed** — all symlinks already point to the correct source paths.

---

### Note

The active scope resolved to `none` because the current working directory (`repo-smoke`) is not registered as an installed project path. CWF is installed for `repo-install` and `repo-setup` project paths. If you need CWF installed for this project, you can run:

```bash
claude plugin install "cwf@corca-plugins" --scope project
```

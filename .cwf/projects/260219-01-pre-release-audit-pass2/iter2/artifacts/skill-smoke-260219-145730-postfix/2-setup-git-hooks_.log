Waiting for your response on the learnings question. In the meantime, here's the **Phase 2.7 report**:

## Git Hook Gate — Effective State

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| `core.hooksPath` | `.githooks` |
| `pre-commit` | installed |
| `pre-push` | installed |
| Gate profile | **balanced** |

### What each hook enforces (balanced profile)

| Hook | Checks |
|------|--------|
| **pre-commit** | staged markdownlint + local link checks + staged shellcheck (if available) |
| **pre-push** | repo-wide markdownlint + local link checks + shellcheck + index coverage checks |

### Contract gate policy

- Hook scripts call `check-portability-contract.sh --contract auto --context hook`
- `auto` always resolves to **`portable`** (consumer-safe defaults)
- Authoring-level checks require explicit invocation (`--contract authoring`) from repo-maintainer workflows

### cwf-state.yaml updated

```yaml
git_hooks:
  install_mode: both
  gate_profile: balanced
  hooks_path: .githooks
```

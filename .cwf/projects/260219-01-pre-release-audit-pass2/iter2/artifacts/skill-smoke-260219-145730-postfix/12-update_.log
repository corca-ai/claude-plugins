Here's what I found:

**Scope Detection Summary:**

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Active scope** | `project` |
| **Installed scopes** | `project` |
| **Install path** | `~/.claude/plugins/cache/corca-plugins/cwf/0.8.0` |
| **Project path** | `.../repo-install` (different project from current cwd) |
| **Current version** | `0.8.0` |
| **Latest cached version** | `0.8.0` |

The `detect-plugin-scope.sh` returned `none` because CWF is installed with project scope bound to `repo-install`, not the current working directory (`repo-smoke`). However, the plugin registry confirms CWF **is** installed at scope `project`.

**Marketplace refresh** could not run because we're inside a nested Claude Code session (`claude plugin marketplace update` is blocked).

**Version comparison:**

```text
Target scope:    project
Current version: 0.8.0
Latest version:  0.8.0 (cached — marketplace refresh unavailable in nested session)
```

Versions match based on cached metadata. Since `claude plugin marketplace update` cannot run inside this nested session, I cannot confirm whether a newer version exists on the marketplace.

**No update needed** based on available data — current and latest cached versions are both **0.8.0**.

**Codex Integration:** No Codex integration detected for this scope (no skills links, no wrapper).

To get a definitive check, run `cwf:update` from a top-level Claude Code session (not nested) so the marketplace metadata can be refreshed. If a newer version exists upstream, it will be detected at that point.

## Implementation Complete

### BDD Criteria Coverage

| # | Scenario | Status | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|
| 1 | `hello.txt` exists at repo root | **Covered** | File created at `hello.txt` |
| 2 | `hello.txt` contains exactly "Hello, smoke test!" | **Covered** | Verified via Read — content matches |
| 3 | `git status` shows hello.txt as new/staged | **Covered** | Committed as `8df3333` on `feat/minimal-smoke-plan` |

### Qualitative Assessment

| Criterion | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Change is atomic and trivially reversible | Single file, single commit — `git revert 8df3333` reverses it |
| No existing files are modified | Only `hello.txt` was created; no existing files touched |

### Files Modified

| File | Action | Agent |
|------|--------|-------|
| `hello.txt` | Created | direct |

### Issues

- `check-session.sh --impl` failed because `cwf-state.yaml` lacks session entries (sandbox isn't fully bootstrapped with CWF session infrastructure). Non-blocking for smoke test purpose.
- Lesson recorded in `lessons.md`: live-state script requires pre-existing `cwf-state.yaml`.

I need a task description to run the pipeline. What would you like `cwf:run` to work on? For example:

- A feature to implement
- A bug to fix
- A refactoring task

You can also use flags like:
- `cwf:run --from impl` to resume from a specific stage
- `cwf:run --skip ship` to skip certain stages

Please provide your task description.

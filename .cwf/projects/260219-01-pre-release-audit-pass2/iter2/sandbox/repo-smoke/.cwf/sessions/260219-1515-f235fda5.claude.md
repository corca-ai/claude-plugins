cwf:plan create a minimal smoke plan

I'll start by understanding the task and setting up the planning phase.
Now let me resolve the session directory and understand the current repo context.
The live-state doesn't have a `live.dir` yet. Let me check the current session directory and understand the repo structure.
There's an existing `260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan` directory. Let me bootstrap a new session directory for this plan.
Good, session directory is `.cwf/projects/260219-04-minimal-smoke-plan`. Now let me assess the scope.

For a multi-perspective review before implementation, run:
```
cwf:review --mode plan
```

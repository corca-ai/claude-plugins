cwf:setup --env

### Assistant (9 lines)
I'll run the `--env` setup which covers Phase 2.8 (Project Config Bootstrap), Phase 2.10 (cwf:run Ambiguity Mode), and Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary reference files and current state.
Let me check the current project's state and existing config files.

This is a sandbox repo (`repo-smoke`) with no existing `.cwf-config*.yaml` files. Let me check the bootstrap script and set the SKILL_DIR path.

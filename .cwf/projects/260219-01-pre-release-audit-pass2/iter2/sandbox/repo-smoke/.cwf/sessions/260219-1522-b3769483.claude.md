I'll start the CWF full pipeline. Let me first initialize by checking the current state and environment.
Before proceeding with the pipeline, I need to know what task you'd like to work on. The `cwf:run` pipeline needs a task description to orchestrate.
What task should the `cwf:run` pipeline execute? I need a task description to start the full gather → clarify → plan → review → impl → review → refactor → retro → ship pipeline.

You can either:
- **Type a task description** directly
- Or I can **infer from the branch context** (`feat/minimal-smoke-plan` + recent commits)

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:run`
2. Bash `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
3. Bash `git branch --show-current`
4. AskUserQuestion "What task should the cwf:run pipeline execute? Please descri" [Describe task]
5. AskUserQuestion "What task should the cwf:run pipeline execute? Please descri" [Type below, Use branch context]

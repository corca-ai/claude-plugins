cwf:clarify --light smoke test only

### Assistant (22 lines → truncated)
I'll run the clarify skill in light mode for your smoke test request.

I'm running `cwf:clarify --light` for "smoke test only".

**Phase 1: Capture**
...(12 lines truncated)...
- **New plan** — Draft a new minimal plan to test `cwf:plan` itself
- **Full pipeline** — Run `cwf:run` end-to-end as a smoke test of the CWF toolchain
- **This was it** — You wanted `cwf:clarify` itself to run as the smoke test, and it just did

Which one?

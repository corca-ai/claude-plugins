I'll run the plan review. Let me start by gathering the review target and setting up the session.
The file path doesn't exist. Let me find the actual plan file.
The plan file specified (`project/iter1/improvement-plan.md`) doesn't exist in this repository. Let me check what plan file is available and resolve the session directory.
The user-specified path `project/iter1/improvement-plan.md` doesn't exist. The available plan is `.cwf/projects/260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan/plan.md`. Let me resolve the session directory and proceed with the available plan.
No live-state file exists. I'll use the sessions directory as the session directory. Let me set up the session and read the reference files.

I'll run a plan review on the specified improvement plan. Let me start by gathering the necessary context.
The plan file path doesn't exist at the assumed location. Let me find the actual file.

The review target path `project/iter1/improvement-plan.md` doesn't exist. Let me search for it more broadly.
The file `project/iter1/improvement-plan.md` does not exist in this repository. This is a smoke-test sandbox repo with minimal content (just `README.md` and `hello.txt`).
...(4 lines truncated)...
- `.cwf/projects/260219-03-refactor-quick-scan/plan.md`
- `.cwf/projects/260219-02-refactor-quick-scan/plan.md`
- `.cwf/projects/260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan/plan.md`

Which file should I review, or would you like to provide a different path?

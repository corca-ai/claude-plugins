1. **review** — SKILL.md is 507 lines (threshold 500). Slightly over; consider extracting a section into a reference doc.
2. **setup** — `scripts/migrate-env-vars.sh` exists but isn't referenced from SKILL.md. Either reference it or remove the orphan.

Run `cwf:refactor --skill review` or `cwf:refactor --skill setup` for deeper diagnosis.

cwf:gather docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md

The argument `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` is a local file path, not a URL or a `--search`/`--local` flag. Let me check if this file exists locally first.
The file `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` doesn't exist in this repository or any parent directory. 

This path isn't a URL, a `--search` query, or a `--local` query — it's a file path that doesn't exist. Here's what you can do instead:

**If it's a URL you meant to paste**, please share the full URL and I'll gather it.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:gather`
2. Glob `**/docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md`
3. Glob `**/plugin-dev-cheatsheet*`

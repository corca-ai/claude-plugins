The file `project/iter1/improvement-plan.md` doesn't exist. The user provided a path argument. The closest plan files are in `.cwf/projects/`.

1. **`.cwf/projects/260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan/plan.md`** — Minimal smoke plan (add hello.txt to verify CWF pipeline)
2. **`.cwf/projects/260219-02-refactor-quick-scan/plan.md`** — Empty stub/placeholder

Could you confirm which plan to review, or provide the correct file path?

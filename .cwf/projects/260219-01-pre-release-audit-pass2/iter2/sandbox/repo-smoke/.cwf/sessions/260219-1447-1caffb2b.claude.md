cwf:run

### Assistant (9 lines)
I'll start by initializing the CWF run pipeline. Let me first understand the current state and environment.
Good, the scripts exist. No task description was provided, so I need to ask the user what task they want to run.
I need a task description to run the pipeline. What task would you like to execute through the full CWF pipeline (gather → clarify → plan → review → impl → review → refactor → retro → ship)?

You can provide:
- A task description (e.g., "Add error handling to the API layer")
- Optional flags: `--from <stage>`, `--skip <stages>`, `--ambiguity-mode <mode>`

Please describe what you'd like to accomplish.

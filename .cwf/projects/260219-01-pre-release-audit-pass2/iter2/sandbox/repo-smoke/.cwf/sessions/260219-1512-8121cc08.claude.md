cwf:setup --env

### Assistant (11 lines → truncated)
I'll run the CWF setup skill for you.

I'll run the `--env` mode which covers Phase 2.8 (Project Config Bootstrap), Phase 2.10 (cwf:run Ambiguity Mode Setup), and Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary references and current state.
...(1 lines truncated)...
Now let me read the configure-run-mode script and check for existing config files.
Good — `.cwf-config.yaml` exists at the repo root but no `.cwf-config.local.yaml` at root level. Let me check the current config and detect the current ambiguity mode.
The env-loader had a shell compatibility issue, but I can see the current state directly from the config file. The current effective mode is `defer-blocking`, already persisted in `.cwf-config.yaml`.

Now let me proceed with the phases. Starting with **Phase 2.8: Project Config Bootstrap**.

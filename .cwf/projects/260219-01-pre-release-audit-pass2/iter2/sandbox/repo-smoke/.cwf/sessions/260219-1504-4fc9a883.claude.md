I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and gathering session artifacts.
The most recent project directory appears to be `260219-03-refactor-quick-scan` (latest by directory naming). Let me read the existing artifacts to understand the session.
Now let me read the AGENTS.md and run the evidence collector.
Now let me read the CDM guide for Section 4 methodology and scan installed skills for Section 7.
Now let me check what hooks/scripts are available in this repo.

cwf:run

### Assistant (13 lines → truncated)
I'll start by initializing the CWF run pipeline. Let me first understand the current state and gather necessary information.
Before proceeding with the full pipeline, I need to know what task you'd like to work on. The `cwf:run` pipeline will orchestrate: gather → clarify → plan → review(plan) → impl → review(code) → refactor → retro → ship.
I need a task description to run the pipeline. What would you like `cwf:run` to work on? For example:

- A feature to implement
...(3 lines truncated)...
You can also use flags like:
- `cwf:run --from impl` to resume from a specific stage
- `cwf:run --skip ship` to skip certain stages

Please provide your task description.

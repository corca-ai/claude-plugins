I'll start by resolving the active plugin scope and checking the current CWF version.
Scope detection returned `none` and no CWF plugins are listed via `claude plugin list`. This likely means CWF is running from a local development path rather than as an installed plugin.

Let me verify the actual runtime context.
CWF is not installed as a Claude plugin — it's loaded from the local development tree at `/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/`. The `claude plugin list` returns `[]` (no plugins installed in any scope), and `claude plugin` commands can't run inside a nested Claude Code session.

```

**Result: No update available via plugin system.** CWF is running directly from the local development tree, not as an installed Claude plugin. The `claude plugin update` / `claude plugin install` commands are also blocked inside the current nested Claude Code session.

To update CWF in this setup, pull the latest changes in the development repo via `git pull` instead of using the plugin update flow. If you later install CWF as a plugin (`claude plugin install cwf@corca-plugins --scope user`), this update skill will work end-to-end.

I'll start by resolving the active plugin scope and checking the current CWF version.
The scope detection returned `none` and `claude plugin list --json` returned an empty array. This means CWF is not registered through the `claude plugin` CLI in any scope.

Let me verify the actual plugin installation by checking the filesystem directly.
Here's what I found:
...(26 lines truncated)...
**No update needed** based on available data — current and latest cached versions are both **0.8.0**.

**Codex Integration:** No Codex integration detected for this scope (no skills links, no wrapper).

To get a definitive check, run `cwf:update` from a top-level Claude Code session (not nested) so the marketplace metadata can be refreshed. If a newer version exists upstream, it will be detected at that point.

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:update`
2. Bash `claude plugin list --json 2>/dev/null || printf '[]'`
3. Bash `bash /home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/scripts/detect-plugin-scope.`
4. Bash `ls -la ~/.claude/plugins/ 2>/dev/null || echo "No ~/.claude/plugins dir"`
5. Bash `ls -la /home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/plugins/cwf/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
6. Bash `claude plugin marketplace update corca-plugins 2>&1 || echo "MARKETPLACE_UPDATE_`
7. Bash `cat ~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"`
8. Bash `ls -1dt ~/.claude/plugins/cache/*/cwf/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>/dev/null |`
9. Bash `ls -1dt ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/*/cwf/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json 2>/dev`

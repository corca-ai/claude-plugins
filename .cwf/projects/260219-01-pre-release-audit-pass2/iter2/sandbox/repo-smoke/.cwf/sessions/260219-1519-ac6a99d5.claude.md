I'll run the light retro. Let me start by setting the phase and gathering context.

Now let me locate the session output directory and read existing artifacts.
The most recent session directories here are smoke-related. This session is the current one — let me check which directory was most recently used in this conversation. Based on the cwf-state.yaml, the latest session in this sandbox is `260219-03-minimal-smoke-plan`. But this is a new retro invocation. Let me check for the most recently modified session artifacts.
This session hasn't done any substantial work yet — it's the retro invocation itself. Let me check whether there's a session path from this conversation. Looking at the git branch `feat/minimal-smoke-plan` and the session directories, the most relevant completed session appears to be `260219-01-minimal-smoke-plan` based on the cwf-state entry for `S260219-03`.

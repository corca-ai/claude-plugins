### User
cwf:setup --git-hooks both --gate-profile balanced

### Assistant (56 lines → truncated)
I'll run Phase 2.7 (Git Hook Gate Installation) and Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint) based on the `--git-hooks both --gate-profile balanced` flags.

Let me start by reading the necessary references and the configure script.
Good, I have the script and reference. The flags `--git-hooks both` and `--gate-profile balanced` are already resolved from the command line, so I can skip the AskUserQuestion prompts and go straight to applying the configuration.

...(46 lines truncated)...
git_hooks:
  install_mode: both
  gate_profile: balanced
  hooks_path: .githooks
```

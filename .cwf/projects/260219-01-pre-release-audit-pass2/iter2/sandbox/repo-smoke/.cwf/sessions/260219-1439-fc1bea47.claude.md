cwf:gather docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md

### Assistant (15 lines → truncated)
The argument `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` is a local file path, not a URL or a `--search`/`--local` flag. Let me check if this file exists locally first.
The file `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` doesn't exist in the current repository or anywhere reachable.

`cwf:gather` expects one of:
- A **URL** (e.g., `https://...`)
...(5 lines truncated)...
1. **If this is a file you want to find or create** — I can search the broader workspace or help draft it.
2. **If this is a URL you meant to paste** — please share the full URL and I'll gather it.
3. **If you want to explore the local codebase for plugin development patterns** — I can run `cwf:gather --local "plugin dev cheatsheet"`.

Which would you like?

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:gather`
2. Glob `**/docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md`
3. Glob `**/plugin-dev-cheatsheet*`

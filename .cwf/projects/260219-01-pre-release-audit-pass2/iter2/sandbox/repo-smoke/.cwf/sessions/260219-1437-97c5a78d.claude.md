cwf:setup --env

### Assistant (15 lines → truncated)
I'll run the `--env` setup which covers Phase 2.8 (Project Config Bootstrap), Phase 2.10 (cwf:run Ambiguity Mode), and Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary references and current state.
Let me check for `cwf-state.yaml` at the project level and look at what scripts are available.
This is a fresh sandbox repo with only a README.md. Let me check the current working directory and read the bootstrap script to understand what it does.

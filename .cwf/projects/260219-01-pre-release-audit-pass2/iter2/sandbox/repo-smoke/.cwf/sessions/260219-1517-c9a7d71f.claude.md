### User
cwf:impl run smoke implementation only

### Assistant (21 lines → truncated)
I'll invoke the `cwf:impl` skill to run the smoke implementation.

I'll start by loading the plan and setting up the implementation. Let me first find the plan and read the necessary reference files.
Multiple plans found. Since the user said "smoke implementation", I'll look for the most recent smoke plan. Let me read the relevant plans and check live state.
Good — this is the most recent smoke plan (260219-04) and it matches the live state's `key_files: [hello.txt]`. Let me also check for phase-handoff and read the current hello.txt.
...(11 lines truncated)...
**Phase Handoff**: not found (proceeding with plan only)
**Phase Protocols**: 0 protocols
**Phase Do NOT**: 0 prohibitions

Proceed with implementation?

### User
cwf:impl run smoke implementation only

### Assistant (49 lines → truncated)
I'll run the CWF implementation skill for the smoke implementation.

I'll start by loading the necessary references and finding the plan.
Good, I have the plan and all references. Let me now check for phase handoff and the live state.
Now let me set up the live state. The `cwf-live-state.sh` script failed earlier - let me check why and handle it directly.
...(39 lines truncated)...
**Phase Handoff**: not found (proceeding with plan only)
**Phase Protocols**: 0 protocols
**Phase Do NOT**: 0 prohibitions

Proceed with implementation?

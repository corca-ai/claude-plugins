cwf:impl run smoke implementation only

I'll start by executing the impl workflow. Let me begin with Phase 0 and Phase 1 in parallel - updating live state and discovering the plan.
The second plan is just a stub. The minimal smoke plan is the clear winner. Let me check for phase-handoff and live-state, then proceed.
Good. Branch is `feat/minimal-smoke-plan` (not a base branch — Phase 0.5 passes). Plan is clear and unambiguous. Let me now update the live state and present the plan summary.
The script fails because `cwf-state.yaml` doesn't exist yet. Let me create it.
Now Phase 1.3 — present the plan summary and confirm.

Implementation complete. To review the code quality and verify against the plan's success criteria, run:

```
cwf:review --mode code
```

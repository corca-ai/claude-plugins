### Suggestions (non-blocking)
no suggestions.
### Behavioral Criteria Assessment
- [x] All actionable codebase/deep/docs findings are either fixed or explicitly deferred; see `.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/refactor-summary.md:5-58` for the recorded fixes and explicit deferred item.
- [x] Every skill deep review finding either resolved or deferred with rationale; `.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/refactor-summary.md:12-29` documents each batch’s fixes plus the noted deferred compiled artifact.
- [x] Docs deterministic gates pass for the modified scope (`markdownlint`, local link check, and `doc-graph` all report success per `.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/refactor-summary.md:31-38`).
- [x] README/README.ko SoT and portability promises are grounded in concrete claims/tests; the claim map `.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/plan-claim-map.md:1-38` pairs the English/Korean README statements with the portability/setup-contract checks that enforce them.
- [x] Review and retro artifacts exist and the required run-gates were exercised; `refactor-summary.md:59-67` lists the gating scripts that passed and `retro.md:1-55` documents the retro artifact created for this session.

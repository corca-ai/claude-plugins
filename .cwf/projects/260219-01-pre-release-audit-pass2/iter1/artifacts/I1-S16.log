The `cwf-state.yaml` is large but I've read it fully. Now let me proceed with the phase steps as requested.

## Phase 2.9: Agent Team Mode Setup

### 2.9.1 — Policy Selection

You requested **Enable Agent Team mode**. Applying now.

### 2.9.2 — Apply

Already executed above. Results:

```
action: enable
settings_file: /home/hwidong/.claude/settings.json
state: enabled
key: CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS
value: 1
```

### 2.9.3 — Effective State

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Settings file | `~/.claude/settings.json` |
| State | **enabled** |
| Key | `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS` |
| Value | `1` |

Restart Claude Code (or open a new session) so Agent Team mode changes are applied consistently.

## Phase 5: Lessons Checkpoint

### 5.1 — Learnings

Any learnings from this setup process? (If none, I'll skip and just update the stage checkpoint.)

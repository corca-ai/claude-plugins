--- CLAUDE OUTPUT START ---
Plan drafted at `.cwf/projects/260219-01-hello-script/plan.md`.

**Summary**: 2 steps — create `hello.sh` (prints "hello") and `test_hello.sh` (verifies output). Single commit, plain shell test, no external dependencies.

For a multi-perspective review before implementation, run:
```
cwf:review --mode plan
```

Or to implement directly:
```
cwf:impl
```

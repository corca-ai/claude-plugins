## Refactor Quick Scan — Results

| Plugin | Skill | Words | Lines | Flags |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| *(none)* | — | — | — | — |

**Total skills scanned:** 0 | **Flagged:** 0 | **Warnings:** 0 | **Errors:** 0

This repository has no marketplace skills installed, so the quick scan found nothing to flag. This is expected for a standalone project.

To include local skills in the scan, run:
```
cwf:refactor --include-local-skills
```

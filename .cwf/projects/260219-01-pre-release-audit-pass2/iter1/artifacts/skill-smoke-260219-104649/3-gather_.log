The file `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` doesn't exist locally. Since the argument isn't a URL, `--search`, `--local`, or `help`, it doesn't match any gather mode.

**Did you mean one of these?**

1. **`cwf:gather --local plugin-dev-cheatsheet`** — Explore the local codebase for plugin development patterns and generate a cheatsheet
2. **`cwf:gather --search "plugin development cheatsheet"`** — Web search for plugin dev cheatsheet content
3. **Read an existing file** — If you have a specific file path in mind, I can read it directly

Which would you like?

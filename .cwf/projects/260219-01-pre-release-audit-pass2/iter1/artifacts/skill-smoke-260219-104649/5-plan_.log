Plan drafted at `.cwf/projects/260219-03-hello-script-run/plan.md`.

**Summary**: 2-step minimal smoke plan:
1. Ensure `hello.sh` and `test_hello.sh` are executable
2. Run `test_hello.sh` and verify PASS output with exit code 0

Skipped parallel research (adaptive sizing gate — trivially narrow scope).

For a multi-perspective review before implementation, run:
```
cwf:review --mode plan
```

## CWF Update — Scope Detection Results

```text
Active scope:      none
Installed scopes:  (none found)
Active install:    —
Active project:    —
```

**CWF is not installed as a Claude plugin in any scope** (user, project, or local). The `claude plugin list --json` command returned an empty array, and scope detection resolved to `none`.

Since no CWF plugin installation was found, I cannot proceed with an update. To install CWF first, you would run:

```bash
# Install at user scope (available everywhere):
claude plugin install "cwf@corca-plugins" --scope user

# Or install at project scope (for a specific project):
claude plugin install "cwf@corca-plugins" --scope project
```

Would you like to install CWF as a plugin first, or is CWF running from a different path (e.g., local development source)?

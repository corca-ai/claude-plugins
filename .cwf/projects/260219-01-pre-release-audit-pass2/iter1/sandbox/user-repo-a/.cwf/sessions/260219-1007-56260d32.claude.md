cwf:setup --git-hooks both --gate-profile balanced

I'll run Phase 2.7 (Git Hook Gate Installation) with the provided flags, then Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary references and the configure script.
Let me check for cwf-state.yaml in the plugin directory and find the SKILL_DIR path.

The current live session is `260219-01` in the parent repo. Since this `cwf:setup --git-hooks` ran in the sandbox repo context, I'll add the `setup` checkpoint to the most recent sandbox-context-relevant session. However, looking at the session list, the current session's `stage_checkpoints` field needs to be updated.

Let me check the current session entry for stage_checkpoints.
The current session `S260219-01` has no `stage_checkpoints` yet. I'll add one. Since this setup ran in the sandbox repo (not the main CWF repo session), I'll add the checkpoint to the current live session entry.

cwf:gather README.md summarize in 3 bullets

### Assistant (9 lines)

I'll invoke the `cwf:gather` skill to fetch and summarize the README.md.

The argument `README.md` is a local file path, not a URL. Let me read it directly and summarize.
No `README.md` exists in the current working directory (`user-repo-b`). Let me check if there's one at the project root.
There is no `README.md` file anywhere in this repository. There's nothing to summarize.

Would you like me to:
1. **Look for a README.md in the parent project** ([claude-plugins/](claude-plugins/))?
2. **Search for other documentation files** in this repo instead?

### Tools

1. Skill `cwf:gather`
2. Read [/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter1/sandbox/user-repo-b/README.md](/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter1/sandbox/user-repo-b/README.md)
3. Glob [**/README.md](**/README.md)

I'll run the Quick Scan mode. Let me start by resolving the session directory and repository root.
The scan found **0 marketplace skills** in this repository. This makes sense — this is a sandbox user repo (`user-repo-b`) on the `feat/hello-script` branch, not the plugin repository itself. There are no marketplace skills installed here.

Let me also check provenance and write the summary.
The gate expects a `## Refactor Summary` heading. Let me fix the summary file.
...(10 lines truncated)...
**Total skills scanned:** 0 | **Flagged:** 0 | **Warnings:** 0 | **Errors:** 0

This repository (`user-repo-b`) has no marketplace skills installed, so there is no skill drift to report. The scan completed cleanly and the persistence gate passed.

To include local skills in the scan, run: `cwf:refactor --include-local-skills`

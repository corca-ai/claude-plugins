### User

cwf:gather README.md summarize in 3 bullets

### Assistant (8 lines)

The argument is `README.md` — a local file path, not a URL or search query. Let me read it directly and summarize.
Let me check what's in the repo.
There is no `README.md` in this repository. The only `.md` files are CWF session logs under [.cwf/sessions/](.cwf/sessions/).

Would you like me to:
1. **Summarize one of the existing session files** instead?
2. **Look for a README.md elsewhere** (e.g., the parent project)?
3. **Create a README.md** for this repo?

### Tools

1. Skill `cwf:gather`
2. Read [/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter1/sandbox/user-repo-b/README.md](/home/hwidong/codes/claude-plugins/.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter1/sandbox/user-repo-b/README.md)
3. Glob [**/*.md](**/*.md)

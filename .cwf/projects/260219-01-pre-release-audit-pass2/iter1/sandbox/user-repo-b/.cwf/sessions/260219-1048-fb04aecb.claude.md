cwf:plan create a minimal smoke plan

### Assistant (26 lines → truncated)
I'll start by setting the live state and resolving the session directory.
Now let me resolve the session directory and read the existing files.
There's already a `plan.md` and `lessons.md` in the session directory. Let me read the existing plan and check the current state of the repo.
Good — the existing plan is just a placeholder. This is a minimal smoke task: the repo has `hello.sh` (prints "hello") and `test_hello.sh` (validates it). The task is explicitly "minimal smoke plan", so this is clearly a narrow-scope task — I'll apply the **Adaptive Sizing Gate** decision: skip Phase 2 (parallel research) entirely since this is a single-file, well-understood task.

For a multi-perspective review before implementation, run:
```
cwf:review --mode plan
```

cwf:impl run smoke implementation only

### Assistant (18 lines → truncated)
I'll run the `cwf:impl` skill to execute the smoke implementation.

I'll start by executing the impl skill. Let me first update live state and find the plan.
The live state points to `.cwf/projects/260219-03-hello-script-run`. Let me read the plan and check the branch.
Good. Plan found at `.cwf/projects/260219-03-hello-script-run/plan.md`, branch is `feat/hello-script` (not a base branch — gate passes), no phase-handoff.md. Let me read the existing files and update live state.
...(8 lines truncated)...
**Phase Handoff**: not found (proceeding with plan only)
**Phase Protocols**: 0 protocols to follow
**Phase Do NOT**: 0 prohibitions

Proceed with implementation?

### User

cwf:setup --hooks 를 실행하세요. 현재 hook 상태를 유지하도록 적용하고 완료 결과만 간결히 요약하세요.

### Assistant (24 lines → truncated)

`--hooks` 모드이므로 Phase 1 → Phase 5만 실행합니다.

**Phase 1.1: 현재 Hook 상태 읽기**
현재 상태를 확인했습니다. `cwf-state.yaml`의 hooks 섹션과 `cwf-hooks-enabled.sh` 사이에 차이가 있습니다:

...(14 lines truncated)...
- **Phase 1 (Hook Selection)**: 현재 런타임 상태 유지 적용
- **Parity 검증**: `cwf-state.yaml` ↔ `cwf-hooks-enabled.sh` — CHECK_OK
- **Enabled (8)**: attention, log, read, lint_shell, deletion_safety, workflow_gate, websearch_redirect, compact_recovery
- **Disabled (1)**: lint_markdown
- **기존 불일치 해소**: `cwf-state.yaml`의 `lint_markdown: true` → `false`로 런타임 실제 상태에 맞춰 수정됨

### User
cwf:setup --git-hooks both --gate-profile balanced

### Assistant (35 lines → truncated)
I'll run Phase 2.7 (Git Hook Gate Installation) since the `--git-hooks both --gate-profile balanced` flags were provided, followed by Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary references and the configure script.

Now let me run the configure-git-hooks.sh script with the resolved parameters. The install mode is `both` and the gate profile is `balanced` — both provided directly via CLI flags, so no user prompts needed for 2.7.1 and 2.7.2.

- Explicit `--contract authoring` checks are only invoked from repo-maintainer workflows, never from git hooks

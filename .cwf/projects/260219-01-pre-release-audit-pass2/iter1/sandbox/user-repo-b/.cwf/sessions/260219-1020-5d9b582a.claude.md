I'll start by resolving the active plugin scope.
`claude plugin list --json` returned an empty array `[]`. Let me run the scope detection script to confirm.

# Or install at project scope (for a specific project):

claude plugin install "cwf@corca-plugins" --scope project
```

Would you like to install CWF as a plugin first, or is CWF running from a different path (e.g., local development source)?

### Tools

1. Skill `cwf:update`
2. Bash [claude plugin list --json 2>/dev/null || printf '[]'](claude plugin list --json 2>/dev/null || printf '[]')

### Assistant (20 lines → truncated)

The [/ship](/ship) command was invoked with no arguments. Let me print the usage message and handle the output persistence.

```text
Ship — GitHub workflow automation for cwf sessions

...(10 lines truncated)...
Now let me persist the `ship.md` output to the session directory as required.
Now let me write the `ship.md` file to the session directory.
Ship output persisted to [.cwf/projects/260219-03-hello-script-run/ship.md](.cwf/projects/260219-03-hello-script-run/ship.md).

To proceed, run [/ship](/ship) with a subcommand — e.g., [/ship pr](/ship pr) to create a pull request from the current [feat/hello-script](feat/hello-script) branch.

cwf:gather README.md summarize in 3 bullets

### Assistant (6 lines)

The argument `README.md` is a local file path, not a URL. Let me read it directly and summarize.
There is no `README.md` file in this repository. The project doesn't contain a README to summarize.

Would you like me to:
- Look for other documentation files in the repo instead?
- Create a README based on the project contents?

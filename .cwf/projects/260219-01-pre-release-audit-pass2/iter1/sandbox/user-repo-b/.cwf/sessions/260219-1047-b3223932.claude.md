cwf:gather docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md

### Assistant (12 lines → truncated)
I'll run the CWF gather skill to collect information from that file.

The argument `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` is a local file path, not a URL, `--search`, `--local`, or `help`. Let me check if this file exists locally first.
The file `docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md` doesn't exist locally. Since the argument isn't a URL, `--search`, `--local`, or `help`, it doesn't match any gather mode.

...(2 lines truncated)...
1. **`cwf:gather --local plugin-dev-cheatsheet`** — Explore the local codebase for plugin development patterns and generate a cheatsheet
2. **`cwf:gather --search "plugin development cheatsheet"`** — Web search for plugin dev cheatsheet content
3. **Read an existing file** — If you have a specific file path in mind, I can read it directly

Which would you like?

### Tools
1. Skill `cwf:gather`
2. Glob `**/docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md`
3. Glob `**/plugin-dev-cheatsheet*`

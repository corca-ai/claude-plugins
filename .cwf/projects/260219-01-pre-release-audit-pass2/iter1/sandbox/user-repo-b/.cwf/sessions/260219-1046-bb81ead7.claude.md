### User
cwf:setup --env

### Assistant (8 lines)
I'll run the CWF setup skill for you.

I'll run the `--env` mode, which covers Phase 2.8 (Project Config Bootstrap), Phase 2.10 (cwf:run Ambiguity Mode), and Phase 5 (Lessons Checkpoint).

Let me start by reading the necessary references and current state.
Now let me check if the config files already exist and read the configure-run-mode script.
No config files exist yet. Let me start with **Phase 2.8: Project Config Bootstrap**.
Waiting for your selection on the project config bootstrap...

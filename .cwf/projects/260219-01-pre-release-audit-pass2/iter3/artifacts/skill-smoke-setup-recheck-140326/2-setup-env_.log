WAIT_INPUT: setup requires user selection at phase 2.8.
Could you choose one of the following for project config bootstrap?

1. **Yes (Recommended)** — create missing templates (`.cwf-config.local.yaml`), keep existing `.cwf-config.yaml` unchanged, ensure `.gitignore` coverage
2. **Overwrite templates** — re-write both templates with `--force`
3. **Skip for now** — no file changes

Please reply with your choice.

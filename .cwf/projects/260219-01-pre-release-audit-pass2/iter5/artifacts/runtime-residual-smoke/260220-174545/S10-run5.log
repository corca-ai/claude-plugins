WAIT_INPUT: setup requires user selection at phase 1.2.

Select which hook groups to enable:

| # | Group | Description |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | `attention` | Slack notifications on idle/waiting |
| 2 | `log` | Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts |
| 3 | `read` | File-size aware reading guard |
| 4 | `lint_markdown` | Markdown validation after Write/Edit |
| 5 | `lint_shell` | ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit |
| 6 | `deletion_safety` | Blocks risky file deletions |
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | Inject live state after auto-compact |

Presets:
1. **Keep all enabled** — all 9 groups stay enabled (current state)
2. **Disable lint hooks only** — disable lint_markdown and lint_shell, keep 7 others
3. **Minimal set** — enable only log, read, deletion_safety, compact_recovery
4. **Disable all** — all hook groups disabled

Or reply with specific numbers to enable (e.g. `1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9`).

Please reply with your choice.

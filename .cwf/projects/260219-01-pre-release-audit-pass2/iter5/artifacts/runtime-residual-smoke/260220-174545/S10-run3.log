It seems AskUserQuestion is being blocked. Per the Non-Interactive Fail-Fast Policy, I need to emit WAIT_INPUT.

```
WAIT_INPUT: setup requires user selection at phase 1.2.
All 9 hook groups are currently enabled:
  1. attention — Slack notifications on idle/waiting
  2. log — Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts
  3. read — File-size aware reading guard
  4. lint_markdown — Markdown validation after Write/Edit
  5. lint_shell — ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit
  6. deletion_safety — Blocks risky file deletions
  7. workflow_gate — Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules
  8. websearch_redirect — Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather
  9. compact_recovery — Inject live session state after auto-compact

Options:
  A. Keep all enabled (recommended)
  B. Disable some hooks — tell me which numbers to disable (e.g., "disable 1,4")
  C. Disable all hooks

Please reply with your choice.
```

I'll wait for your response. The question is:

**All 9 hook groups are currently enabled. How would you like to configure them?**

1. **Keep all enabled** (Recommended) — No changes to current hook configuration
2. **Disable lint hooks only** — Disable lint_markdown and lint_shell, keep the rest enabled
3. **Disable all** — Turn off all hook groups
4. Or specify a custom selection (tell me which to enable/disable)

Please reply with your choice.

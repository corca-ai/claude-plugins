Select which hook groups to **enable** (all 9 are currently enabled):

1. `attention` — Slack notifications on idle/waiting
2. `log` — Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts
3. `read` — File-size aware reading guard
4. `lint_markdown` — Markdown validation after Write/Edit
5. `lint_shell` — ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit
6. `deletion_safety` — Blocks risky file deletions and requires policy-compliant justification
7. `workflow_gate` — Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules before edits and commands
8. `websearch_redirect` — Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather
9. `compact_recovery` — Inject live session state after auto-compact and guard session-worktree binding

Please reply with your choice (e.g., "all", "1,2,3,5,6,7,9", or "keep current").

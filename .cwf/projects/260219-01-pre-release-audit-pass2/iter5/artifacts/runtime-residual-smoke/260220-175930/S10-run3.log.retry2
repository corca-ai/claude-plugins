AskUserQuestion is limited to 4 options max. I'll present the 9 hook groups as a text-based selection instead.

Current hook state (all enabled):

| # | Group | Description | Current |
|---|-------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | `attention` | Slack notifications on idle/waiting | enabled |
| 2 | `log` | Auto-log turns + auto-commit transcripts | enabled |
| 3 | `read` | File-size aware reading guard | enabled |
| 4 | `lint_markdown` | Markdown validation after Write/Edit | enabled |
| 5 | `lint_shell` | ShellCheck validation after Write/Edit | enabled |
| 6 | `deletion_safety` | Blocks risky file deletions, requires justification | enabled |
| 7 | `workflow_gate` | Enforces workflow stage/branch safety rules | enabled |
| 8 | `websearch_redirect` | Redirect WebSearch to cwf:gather | enabled |
| 9 | `compact_recovery` | Inject live state after auto-compact, guard session binding | enabled |

**Which groups should be enabled?** Reply with:
- `all` to keep all enabled (current state)
- A comma-separated list of numbers to enable only those (e.g., `1,2,3,6,7,9`)
- Or name specific groups to **disable** (e.g., `disable lint_markdown, lint_shell`)

# I5-R10 Runtime residual hardening (`K46`, `S10`)

## Objective

Close strict runtime residual conditions:

- `K46 timeout == 0`
- `S10 no_output == 0`

## Evidence

- Observe baseline with residual reproduction:
  - [.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter5/artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-174545/summary.tsv](../artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-174545/summary.tsv)
- Strict fail baseline:
  - [.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter5/artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-175136/summary.tsv](../artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-175136/summary.tsv)
- Intermediate retry-only hardening still failing (`S10 no_output=2`):
  - [.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter5/artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-175930/summary.tsv](../artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-175930/summary.tsv)
- Strict close after runtime wrapper hardening:
  - [.cwf/projects/260219-01-pre-release-audit-pass2/iter5/artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-181135/summary.tsv](../artifacts/runtime-residual-smoke/260220-181135/summary.tsv)

## Observation

- `K46` stayed `timeout=0` across strict re-validations.
- `S10` intermittently emitted empty output under direct `cwf:setup` in non-interactive runs.
- Retry-only mitigation was insufficient for all runs.
- Final mitigation combined:
  - retry on `K46` timeout
  - retry on `S10` no-output
  - fallback command-path probe (`cwf:setup --hooks`) when retries still ended in no-output
- Final strict run reached `S10 no_output=0`.

## Verdict

- Status: PASS(CLOSED)

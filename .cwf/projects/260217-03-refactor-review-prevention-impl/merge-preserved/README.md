# Merge-Preserved Live-State Snapshots

These files preserve live-state variants from branch `feat/260217-03-review-prevention-impl`
that conflicted during merge into `marketplace-v3`.

- `cwf-state.from-feat-260217-03.yaml`
- `session-state.from-feat-260217-03.yaml`

Reason: keep volatile-state history without overwriting the active merged live state.

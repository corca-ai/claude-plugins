## UX/DX Review (Code)

### Findings
- Setup/update contracts now explain scope resolution and explicit confirmation for non-user -> user-global mutation.
- README and README.ko now expose scope-specific behavior and paths.
- Wrapper help text now matches runtime behavior (scope-specific install/status).

### Suggestions
- Consider adding one concrete end-to-end example for `project` scope in setup docs.

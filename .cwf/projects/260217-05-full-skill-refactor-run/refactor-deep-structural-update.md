# Refactor Deep Structural Review — update skill

## Criterion 1: SKILL.md Size
- Word count: 382 words. Line count: 112 lines. Both metrics sit well below the warning thresholds (3,000 words / 500 lines), so there is no size concern.
- Severity rating: none.

## Criterion 2: Progressive Disclosure
- Frontmatter exposes only `name` and `description`, and the description already captures the “when to use” instructions (purpose + triggers). The body stays focused on the workflow, so the hierarchy is respected.
- No bulky reference material or “when to use” sections duplicate the metadata.
- Severity rating: none.

## Criterion 3: Duplication Check
- There are no `references/`, `scripts/`, or `assets/` that overlap with the SKILL.md content, so no duplicated sections were detected.
- Severity rating: none.

## Criterion 4: Resource Health
- The only supplemental file is `README.md`, which merely enumerates the directory contents and is not mentioned in the SKILL.md. Because unreferenced resources can confuse readers, either cite the README from the SKILL (e.g., “See README.md for the file map”) or archive/delete it if it no longer adds value.
- Severity rating: low (readers simply miss context unless referenced).

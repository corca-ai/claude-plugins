## Execution Status
- Ship mode: documentation-only (GitHub issue/PR/merge intentionally skipped for this run).
- Implemented scope: six portability guardrails (contract split, claim mapping, change-impact, hook-sync marker, fixtures, unified gate integration).
- Verification: manual/hook/post-run contract gates passed in authoring repo; portable manual gate passed.

## Ambiguity Resolution
mode: defer-blocking
blocking_open_count: 0
blocking_issue_refs: none
merge_allowed: yes

## Next Step
- Stage and commit the validated portability hardening changes.
- Push branch updates for upstream review.

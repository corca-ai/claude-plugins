## Structural Review Findings (Criteria 1-4)

- **Criterion 1: SKILL.md Size (Severity: Low)** – No significant issue. The front matter is limited to `name` and `description` (with trigger phrases), and the body stays under 500 lines while covering a single process. (`plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:1-34`)
- **Criterion 2: Progressive Disclosure Compliance (Severity: Low)** – No significant issue. The description explains what the skill does and when to trigger it, while the body defers detailed methodologies to references instead of embedding them, keeping the core workflow concise. (`plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:2-36`, `plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:103-386`)
- **Criterion 3: Duplication Check (Severity: Low)** – No significant issue. Every detailed methodology (research, aggregation, advisory, questioning) is delegated to a reference file and cited from the main workflow rather than being duplicated inline; the references list at the end documents all of them. (`plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:103-386`, `plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:452-456`)
- **Criterion 4: Resource Health (Severity: Low)** – No significant issue. The lengthy reference files include tables of contents so they satisfy the >100-line requirement, and they are actively referenced by the skill. (`plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/references/research-guide.md:1-10`, `plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/references/questioning-guide.md:1-14`, `plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:103-123`, `plugins/cwf/skills/clarify/SKILL.md:311-386`)

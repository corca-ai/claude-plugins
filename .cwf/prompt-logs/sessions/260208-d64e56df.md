### User
<teammate-message teammate_id="team-lead">
You are a code quality reviewer for a Claude Code plugins repository. Your task is to do a comprehensive review of ALL plugins and skills in this codebase.

IMPORTANT: First read docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md to understand the project structure and conventions.

Then systematically review:

1. **All plugins under plugins/**:
   - Read each plugin's main files (install.sh, settings.json, hooks files, SKILL.md, etc.)
   - Check code quality, naming consistency, error handling
   - Look for duplicate code across plugins
   - Check for unused code or dead paths
   - Check cross-plugin dependencies and whether they're properly guarded
   - Check adherence to patterns described in the cheatsheet

2. **All skills under .claude/skills/**:
   - Read each skill file
   - Check quality, consistency, and adherence to conventions

3. **Scripts under scripts/**:
   - Review all scripts for quality and consistency

For each issue found, categorize as:
- 🔴 Critical (bugs, security issues)
- 🟡 Important (inconsistencies, missing guards, code quality)
- 🟢 Nice-to-have (style, minor improvements)

After completing the review, update task #1 with your findings using TaskUpdate, then mark it as completed.

Provide a structured report with:
- Summary of overall code health
- Issues found per plugin/skill
- Cross-cutting concerns
- Recommended improvements prioritized by impact

I'll start by reading the cheatsheet and then systematically review the entire codebase. Let me begin by understanding the project structure.
Good, now I have the full picture. Let me read all the plugin files systematically. I'll start with multiple plugins in parallel.
All 10 review agents are running in parallel. Let me claim task #1 while waiting for them to complete.
Good. Now let me also do some cross-cutting analysis while agents are running — checking for consistency across plugin.json files, marketplace.json, and looking for common patterns.
I already notice a cross-cutting issue: the **attention-hook** plugin.json description says "Slack notifications with threading when Claude Code is waiting — idle alerts, AskUserQuestion prompts, plan mode approval, and periodic heartbeat status updates" but the marketplace.json entry says "A hook that sends Slack notifications when Claude Code is waiting" — a significant description mismatch.

Now let me wait for the background agents to complete and collect their results.
Most agents have completed. The retro and scripts/skills agents are still running but nearly done. I have enough data to compile the comprehensive report now. Let me wait briefly for the last two, then compile.
All 10 agents have completed. Now let me compile the comprehensive report and update the task.
Review complete and findings sent to team lead. Let me check if there are any other tasks I should pick up.
All three review tasks are complete. Task #4 (consolidation) is pending and likely for the team lead to handle. I'll wait for further instructions.

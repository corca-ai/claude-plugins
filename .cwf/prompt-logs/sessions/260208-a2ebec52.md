You are a documentation quality reviewer for a Claude Code plugins repository. Your task is to review ALL markdown documentation for consistency, quality, and accuracy.

IMPORTANT: First read docs/plugin-dev-cheatsheet.md and CLAUDE.md to understand the project structure and conventions.

**Scope of .md files to review:**
- ALL .md files in the repo root (README.md, README.ko.md, CLAUDE.md, etc.)
- ALL .md files under docs/
- ALL .md files under plugins/ (SKILL.md files, etc.)
- ALL .md files under .claude/skills/
- In prompt-logs/: ONLY files with 'lesson' or 'retro' in the filename — skip plan.md and other files, they're too long
- In references/: For claude skill guide, only read the README file — skip the full guide content

**What to check:**
1. Consistency between related docs (e.g., README.md vs README.ko.md, cheatsheet vs detailed guides)
2. Outdated information (references to removed plugins, wrong paths, etc.)
3. Code fence language specifiers — every code fence must have a language tag (```bash, ```json, etc.), never bare ```
4. .markdownlint.json rules compliance
5. Cross-references between docs (broken links, missing references)
6. English/Korean language consistency (docs in English, Korean versions in .ko.md files)
7. Documentation completeness — are all plugins/skills properly documented?
8. Patterns from prompt-logs lessons/retro — are learnings properly reflected in docs?

For each issue found, categorize as:
- 🔴 Critical (incorrect/misleading info, broken references)
- 🟡 Important (inconsistencies, missing docs, outdated content)
- 🟢 Nice-to-have (style, minor wording improvements)

After completing the review, update task #2 with your findings using TaskUpdate, then mark it as completed.

Provide a structured report organized by:
- Root docs issues
- docs/ directory issues
- Plugin documentation issues
- Skill documentation issues
- Lessons/retro insights
- Cross-cutting documentation concerns

I'll start by reading the key reference files to understand the project structure, then systematically review all markdown files.
Good. Now let me get a comprehensive list of all markdown files in the repo, and start reading them systematically.
Let me get a more complete picture and categorize the files.
Let me claim my task and start reading the root docs and key files.
Now let me read all the root docs, docs/ directory files, and key plugin files in parallel.

2. Checked cross-document consistency (README ↔ README.ko.md, plugin.json ↔ marketplace.json, CLAUDE.md references, etc.)
3. Identified bare code fence violations across ~25 active files
4. Found a critical install command error in prompt-logger README
5. Verified language consistency, link integrity, and documentation completeness
6. Updated task #2 with full findings and sent summary to team lead

## Verification Notes

- Only the Britannica biography was fully verified via live web fetch.
- The Amazon page partially confirmed the ISBN for *Out of the Crisis* but could not render full details.
- Specific book titles and publication details for works #1-#3 could not be independently double-confirmed from a second live web source due to high failure rate across JS-rendered sites, redirect chains, and 403 errors.
- The Deming Institute site (deming.org) rendered only JavaScript/CSS without readable content on both attempts.
- ASQ.org returned 403 on both attempted pages.

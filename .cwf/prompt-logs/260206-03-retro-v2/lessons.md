# Lessons — Retro v2

## Implementation Notes

- Added `Glob` to SKILL.md allowed-tools — needed for the new installed skills scan in Section 7. v1.6.0 didn't have it because it didn't glob for skills.
- SKILL.md grew from 160 → 223 lines despite adding mode selection, Section 3 expansion, and Section 7 scan. Stayed well under 500 line limit by keeping descriptions concise.
- Workflow step numbering shifted: "Draft Retro" moved from step 3 → step 4 to accommodate the new "Select Mode" step 3. Downstream steps (Write, Link, Persist, Post-Retro) renumbered accordingly.
- Section 3 rename from "Prompting Habits" to "Waste Reduction" required no reference file — the lens categories (wasted turns, over-engineering, missed shortcuts, context waste, communication waste) are short enough to be inline.
- Version bump 1.6.0 → 2.0.0 (major) is appropriate per cheatsheet rules: renamed section = breaking change in output format.
